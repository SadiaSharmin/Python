Python, like many other modern coding languages, is at its heart “object-oriented”. To use Python to its fullest requires the use of its object-oriented features. These features allow for greater modularity, easier troubleshooting, greater reuse of code and a greater flexibility and utility of a given section of code.  This course combines a discussion of the principles of object-oriented coding with implementation details and syntax specific to Python.
