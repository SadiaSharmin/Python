Now, you'll have the opportunity to practice what you've learned so far on some projects whose scope, contents and complexity is more similar to what you might encounter in the real world. In many of these cases, the basic data will be provided for you in lists. In others, you will be asked to write simple code to generate the data in an appropriate format.  It is up to you to take what you've learned and produce plots which are informative, clear, and attractive.\n",

Feel free to use the Matplotlib documentation and/or your favourite search engine to find out how to create effects.
